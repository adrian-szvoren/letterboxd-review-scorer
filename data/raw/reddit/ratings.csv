-1,IGN_short,5,"Masterpiece"
-1,IGN_glong,5,"Simply put: this is our highest recommendation. There‚Äôs no such thing as a truly perfect game, but those that earn a Masterpiece label from IGN come as close as we could reasonably hope for. These are classics in the making that we hope and expect will influence game design for years to come, as other developers learn from their shining examples."
-1,IGN_short,4.5,"Amazing"
-1,IGN_glong,4.5,"We enthusiastically recommend that you add these games to your to-play list. If we call a game Amazing, that means something about it seriously impressed us, whether it‚Äôs an inspired new idea or an exceptional take on an old one. We expect to look back at it as one of the highlights of its time and genre."
-1,IGN_short,4,"Great"
-1,IGN_glong,4,"These games leave us with something outstanding to remember them by, usually novel gameplay ideas for single-player or multiplayer, clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof. If we have major complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out."
-1,IGN_short,3.5,"Good"
-1,IGN_glong,3.5,"Playing a Good game is time well spent. Could it be better? Absolutely. Maybe it lacks ambition, is too repetitive, has a few technical bumps in the road, or is too repetitive, but we came away from it happy nonetheless. We think you will, too."
-1,IGN_short,3,"Okay"
-1,IGN_glong,3,"These recommendations come with a boatload of ifs. There‚Äôs a good game in here somewhere, but in order to find it you‚Äôll have to know where to look, and perhaps turn a blind eye to some significant drawbacks."
-1,IGN_short,2.5,"Mediocre"
-1,IGN_glong,2.5,"This is the kind of bland, unremarkable game we‚Äôve mostly forgotten about a day after we finish playing. A mediocre game isn‚Äôt something you should spend your time or money on if you consider either to be precious, but they‚Äôll pass the time if you have nothing better to do."
-1,IGN_short,2,"Bad"
-1,IGN_glong,2,"For one reason or another, these games made us wish we‚Äôd never played them. Even if there‚Äôs a good idea or two in there somewhere, they‚Äôre buried under so many bad ones and poor execution we simply can‚Äôt recommend you waste your time on it."
-1,IGN_short,1.5,"Awful"
-1,IGN_glong,1.5,"You‚Äôre welcome. We just saved you from making a terrible mistake by buying this collection of poorly executed, bad, or unoriginal ideas ‚Äì or even playing it for free. While even a Bad game generally has some bright spots, an Awful one is consistently unenjoyable."
-1,IGN_short,1,"Painful"
-1,IGN_glong,1,"Let‚Äôs face it: anything worse than Bad is a trainwreck. Worse than Awful? That‚Äôs kind of impressive. Not only are these games not fun, but they‚Äôre outright infuriating or insulting."
-1,IGN_short,0.5,"Unbearable"
-1,IGN_glong,0.5,"The silver lining of these dark clouds is that they‚Äôre often so poorly made that they crap out after a certain point (if they ever worked at all), so we were spared from any permanent effects that playing a game this terrible might have on our brains. We don't always take the time to write up reviews of games that are this obviously bad, but they're out there."

0,austinrose7,0.5,"I‚Äôve only ever rated one film this low (Green Lantern 2011), so I guess this rating is my least favorite film of all-time. I can almost always find at least one redeemable quality in a film, but not if it gets this rating."

0,austinrose7,2.5,"Bad film with a few good elements in it. Bad films with a great performance from the lead(s) will get this."
0,austinrose7,3,"I liked it more than I disliked it, but barely. Mediocre films end up here."
0,austinrose7,3.5,"Mediocre film with one or more great elements in it, or a good film with one or more mediocre/bad elements in it. Dull, by-the-numbers, Oscar-bait biopics with a transformative, truly impressive performance from the lead will get this, or good films that are bogged down by a weak/miscast leading performance. Also blockbusters/action flicks that are entertaining but utterly forgettable will usually get this rating."
0,austinrose7,4,"Excellent film. Going from a 3.5 to 4 is a fairly big jump in quality for me, as is any subsequent higher rating from here on."
0,austinrose7,4.5,"Near-masterpiece. Films I love and will definitely revisit in my lifetime. Films with this rating will VERY likely break my all-time top 100."
0,austinrose7,5,"Masterpiece. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be a 100% perfect film, but it better be damn close. 1-2 minor flaws max. Films I adore with all my heart and will rewatch over and over (at least once every 2-3 years) for the rest of my life. Films with this rating will be in my top 100."

0,airandrising,1,"just bad. Just a bad movie, nothing reedemable about it. Often struggle to see these ones through to the end."
0,airandrising,1.5,"generally movies that aren't necessarily awful, but certainly weren't my thing."
0,airandrising,2,"these are normally bad movies that are funny. Not funny enough to be rated higher on entertainment factor alone, but funny enough that they've escape a 1 star rating because I enjoyed making fun of it."
0,airandrising,2.5,"normally rated when I'm a bit torn. Often films I loved one aspect of (the concept, the acting, the characters) but absolutely hated everything else."
0,airandrising,3,"just a movie. The kind of movie you put on because you're tired, or hungover, or sick. These movies are more good than bad, but I wouldn't get excited over them. Kids/teen movies (like Aquamarine, or Wild Child) Fall into this category a lot."
0,airandrising,3.5,"literally just the middle ground between 3 and 4. I liked it, I'll talk highly of it, but it doesn't have the same repayability of 3 or 4"
0,airandrising,4,"a really good movie. The kind of movie you walk out of a cinema after watching and feel energised."

0,airandrising,5,"a pretty rare rating, but these are the films I'd consider part of my being. This ones a bit disconnected though, because its based on my feelings and not how good i think it is as a movie- there's some movies in this rating i can recognise suck, but they're still a 5 to me. Movies never get a 5 star on the first watch, they earn their place thropugh rewatches."

1,Dizmodo,5,"There are two types of movies that will earn this rating from me. The first is one that pulls me in so well that I am removed from my reality and become engulfed in the picture for the entirety of the film. I feel a part of it, and it a part of me. The second is one that gets me lost in deep thought on the message, plot, or characters. This thought generally runs for days as the greatness of the film resonates deep within me."
1,Dizmodo,4.5,"Didn't quite accomplish one of the two goals in the 5 star rating. It got very close, but there was one thing or another that didn't get it there for me."
1,Dizmodo,4,"These are films I'd still strongly recommend to others. I love these movies, but there are specific things I wish had been modified or avoided altogether."
1,Dizmodo,3.5,"Largely enjoyable films. I see this being the most prominent rating for me over time. A lot of superhero films will land here. There's substance in these movies, there's a little meaning, there's fun as well. However, these aren't movies I'll be thinking about for days."
1,Dizmodo,3,"Movies that I simply liked. I watched, I enjoyed, I moved on. Nothing exceptional, but still not considered a waste of time."
1,Dizmodo,2.5,"I think of these movies as those where I'm easily distracted. I probably looked at my phone a lot during these movies, but I found enjoyment somewhere along the way."
1,Dizmodo,2,"I'm having to REALLY dig to find things that I found valuable. Maybe a single character or scene that I liked. I understood what was attempting to be portrayed, but it just didn't work for me."
1,Dizmodo,1.5,"I'm seeing basically no value in these movies. I've wasted part of my life watching these and wish I could get my time back. It's possible I'll still respect the filmmakers in these movies as I try to understand what they were hoping to accomplish."
1,Dizmodo,1,"There was not a single detail, character, scene, or plot point that worked for me. I likely hold a strong hatred for movies with this rating as they stole time from my life that I can never get back; time spent watching the movie as well as the time spent steaming about how bad it was."
1,Dizmodo,0.5,"Why is this a thing? How did this get funding? If televisions were cheap, I'd smash the screen out of hatred for these movies."

4,Cletus_awreetus,0.5,"I consider it one of my least favorite films of all time. It's either made horribly with no redeeming qualities, or it takes a position on a topic that I find irredeemable, or it is just so stupid that it makes my brain hurt, or it is supremely boring. The kind of film where I'm just in disbelief the whole time about how bad it is"
