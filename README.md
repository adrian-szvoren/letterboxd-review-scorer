# letterboxd-review-scorer

A simple ML app combining sentiment analysis and text classification
that takes a movie review (or simply some thoughts on a movie) and outputs a movie score.

To access the app go to [this link](https://letterscord.streamlit.app/).

Ideas:
- test out transformers and LLM
- make it multilingual
- implement explainability
